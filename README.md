## Description
This "Social Network API" project is a back-end application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It serves as the core engine for a social media platform and provides a robust API for managing users, friendships, and thoughts. Users can create profiles, add friends, and share their thoughts, which can also receive reactions from other users. Utilizing MongoDB's NoSQL database, the application efficiently handles complex queries and data relationships. Designed with scalability in mind, this API is perfect for developers looking to integrate social media features into their web or mobile applications.
